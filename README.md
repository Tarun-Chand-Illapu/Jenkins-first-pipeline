# Jenkins-first-pipeline

**🚀 Welcome to our Jenkins Pipeline Repository! 🛠️**

This repository houses the Jenkins pipeline scripts used for automating our Node.js projects' testing process. With this pipeline, we ensure consistent testing environments and smooth integration workflows.

**What's Inside?**

Jenkinsfile: The heart of our CI/CD setup, containing the pipeline configuration written in Groovy syntax.
Dockerfile: Customized Dockerfile for building a Docker image tailored for Node.js testing.
Scripts: Additional scripts used within the pipeline for advanced automation tasks.

**How It Works**

Agent Configuration: The pipeline is configured to run inside a Docker container based on the node:16-alpine image to ensure consistent testing environments.
Stages: The pipeline consists of various stages, with each stage representing a specific step in our testing process.
Test Stage: Within the "Test" stage, we execute the node --version command to verify the Node.js version installed in the Docker container.
